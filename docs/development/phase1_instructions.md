# Phase 1: Foundation - Getting Started

Congratulations on completing Phase 0 of the DIY Cloud Platform! With the Distribution Abstraction Layer in place, you now have a solid foundation that will allow your platform to work across multiple Linux distributions.

Phase 1 focuses on setting up the Core Platform Module, which includes the base system, web portal, and Nginx configuration. This phase is critical as it establishes the framework upon which all other components will be built.

## Goals for Phase 1

According to the project roadmap, Phase 1: Foundation includes:

1. Project Setup (already completed in Phase 0)
2. Core Platform Module implementation
3. Initial cross-distribution testing

## Components to Implement

### 1. Core Platform Module

The Core Platform Module consists of:

- Base system setup script
- Nginx configuration as a reverse proxy
- Basic web portal
- SSL/TLS configuration

### 2. Directory Structure

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Base System Setup Script

Create the `core/setup-base.sh` script that:

1. Uses the Distribution Abstraction Layer to install required packages
2. Configures firewall rules
3. Sets up basic system parameters
4. Prepares directories for the platform

This script should leverage the Distribution Abstraction Layer to ensure it works across different distributions.

### Step 2: Nginx Configuration

Create the Nginx configuration files:

1. Base `nginx.conf` file
2. SSL parameters configuration
3. Virtual host configuration for the web portal

These configurations should be placed in the correct directories based on the distribution, using the path resolution functions from the Distribution Abstraction Layer.

### Step 3: Web Portal Implementation

Create a simple but effective web portal:

1. HTML structure with modern, responsive design
2. CSS for styling
3. JavaScript for basic interactivity
4. Placeholders for future components (JupyterHub, Docker/Portainer, Monitoring)

The portal should be clean, user-friendly, and provide easy navigation to the different services that will be added in future phases.

### Step 4: SSL/TLS Configuration

Implement SSL/TLS support:

1. Certificate generation (self-signed for development)
2. Nginx SSL configuration
3. Security headers and best practices
4. Optional Let's Encrypt integration

### Step 5: Testing Script

Create a test script (`test_core_platform.sh`) to verify that:

1. The base system is set up correctly
2. Nginx is installed and configured properly
3. The web portal is accessible
4. SSL/TLS is working correctly

This script should be run on all target distributions to ensure compatibility.

## Using the Distribution Abstraction Layer

Throughout Phase 1, you'll need to use the Distribution Abstraction Layer to ensure that your implementation works across different Linux distributions.

Examples:

1. Installing packages:
   ```bash
   source lib/detect_distro.sh
   source lib/package_manager.sh
   
   # Install Nginx
   install_package "nginx"
   ```

2. Managing services:
   ```bash
   source lib/service_manager.sh
   
   # Start and enable Nginx
   start_service "nginx"
   enable_service "nginx"
   ```

3. Finding configuration paths:
   ```bash
   source lib/path_resolver.sh
   
   # Get Nginx configuration path
   nginx_conf=$(get_config_path "nginx")
   nginx_sites=$(get_config_path "nginx_sites")
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Cross-Distribution Compatibility**: Test on multiple distributions throughout development.
2. **Modularity**: Keep components independent and modular.
3. **Documentation**: Document all components thoroughly.
4. **Security**: Follow security best practices, especially for Nginx and SSL/TLS.
5. **User Experience**: Create a clean, intuitive web portal interface.

## Testing on Multiple Distributions

To ensure cross-distribution compatibility, test your implementation on:

- Ubuntu 20.04+ LTS
- Debian 11+ (Bullseye)
- CentOS/RHEL 8+
- Fedora 35+
- Arch Linux
- OpenSUSE Leap 15.3+

You can use virtual machines, containers, or cloud instances for testing.

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

Phase 1 is considered complete when:

1. The base system setup script works across all target distributions
2. Nginx is properly configured as a reverse proxy
3. The web portal is accessible and responsive
4. SSL/TLS is properly configured
5. All tests pass on all target distributions

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, you'll move on to Phase 2: User & Resource Management, where you'll implement:

- User creation and management
- Authentication
- Role-based access control
- Resource allocation and limits

Good luck with Phase 1!
