## 2. Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Distribution Detection (detect_distro.sh)

- Identify Linux distribution and version
- Set global variables for distribution information
- Support Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS/RHEL, Fedora, Arch Linux, and OpenSUSE
- Return distribution ID and version

### Stage 2: Package Management (package_manager.sh)

- Abstract package management operations across package managers:
  - apt (Ubuntu, Debian)
  - dnf/yum (Fedora, CentOS/RHEL)
  - pacman (Arch Linux)
  - zypper (OpenSUSE)
- Implement functions for:
  - Package installation
  - Package removal
  - Package update
  - Package search
  - Repository management
- Handle package name differences across distributions

### Stage 3: Service Management (service_manager.sh)

- Abstract service management across init systems:
  - systemd (most modern distributions)
  - SysV init (legacy systems)
- Implement functions for:
  - Service start/stop/restart
  - Service enable/disable
  - Service status check
  - Service configuration

### Stage 4: Path Resolution (path_resolver.sh)

- Abstract file system paths for configuration files
- Handle path differences across distributions
- Implement functions for common service paths:
  - Nginx configuration
  - JupyterHub configuration
  - Docker configuration
  - Log files
  - User home directories

### Stage 5: Resource Management Adaptation (resource_adapter.sh)

- Abstract resource management operations
- Support both cgroups v1 and v2
- Implement functions for:
  - CPU resource allocation
  - Memory limitation
  - Disk quota management
  - GPU access control

## 3. Testing Strategy

- Create virtual machines for each supported distribution
- Develop test scripts for each module
- Verify functionality across all target distributions
- Document distribution-specific edge cases

## 4. Integration Plan

1. Complete each component independently
2. Test each component across all distributions
3. Integrate components within the Distribution Abstraction Layer
4. Test the complete layer
5. Document usage for other modules

## 5. Implementation Timeline

- Day 1-3: Distribution Detection
- Day 4-6: Package Management
- Day 7-9: Service Management
- Day 10-12: Path Resolution
- Day 13-14: Resource Management Adaptation
